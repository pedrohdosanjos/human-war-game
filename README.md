# Human War Game

**Academic project developed in C++ for the Programming Techniques course - UTFPR (1st semester of 2022).**

This project consists of a platform game simulating a battle between human units with movement, attack, and basic combat logic.

## Context

This was one of the first projects I developed during my Computer Engineering degree at UTFPR. It was uploaded to GitHub directly, before I started using Git properly. I keep this project public as part of my learning process and growth as a developer.
